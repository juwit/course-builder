# Course-builder

This repository contains a simple `Dockerfile`, providing an image containing the following :

* an alpine base image
* `curl` / `bash` to run basic scripting
* `task` to run build scripts
* `asciidoctor` to build documentation files
* `decktape` to build pdf from reveal-js slides (depends on `nodejs`)
